# Hacker Statistics
Scenario : You are walking up the empire state building and you're playing a game with a friend. You throw a die one hundred times.

If it's 1 or 2 you'll go one step down
If it's 3, 4, or 5, you'll go one step up
If you throw a 6, you'll throw the die again and will walk up the resulting number of steps
Of course, you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, you admit that you're a bit clumsy and have a chance of 0.1% of falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0. With all of this in mind, you bet with your friend that you'll reach 60 steps high.

In the Empire State Building bet, your next move depends on the number of eyes you throw with the dice.

```
# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
step = 0

dice = np.random.randint(1,7) # Roll the dice   
print(dice)

if dice <= 2 :
    step -= 1
elif dice < 6 :
    step += 1
else :
    step += np.random.randint(1,7)

# Print out dice and step
print("Dice: {} - Steps: {}".format(dice, step))
```
6<br>
Dice: 6 - Steps: 3

Now it's time to put this code inside a for loop so that we can simulate a random walk.

```
# a list random_walk that contains the first step, which is the integer 0
step = 0
random_walk = [0]
for x in range(100):
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
    if dice <= 2 :
        step -= 1
    elif dice < 6 :
        step += 1
    else :
        step += np.random.randint(1,7)
    random_walk.append(step)
print(random_walk)
```
[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 11, 12, 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, 34, 35, 34, 35, 36, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 40, 39, 40, 41, 40, 39, 40, 41, 43, 42, 41, 42, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 49, 48, 49, 48, 49, 50, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 54, 55, 56, 60]

The code calculates the location in the Empire State Building after 100 dice throws. However, there's an issue, we can't go below 0! A typical way to solve problems like this is by using max(). If you pass max() two arguments, the biggest one gets returned.

```
# Use max() to make sure that step doesn't go below zero if dice <= 2
step = 0
random_walk = [0]

for x in range(20) :
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    if dice <= 2:
        step = max(0, step - 1)
    elif dice < 6:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
    random_walk.append(step)
print(random_walk)
```
[0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22]

### Visualize the walk
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(random_walk, color="dodgerblue", linewidth=3)
plt.ylabel("random_walk")
plt.show()
```

### Simulate multiple walks

To get an idea about how big your chances are of reaching 60 steps, you can repeatedly simulate the random walk and collect the results.
```
all_walks = []
# Simulate random walk 20 times
for i in range(20) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(10) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        random_walk.append(step)
        
    # Append random_walk to all_walks
    all_walks.append(random_walk)
print(all_walks)
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 8], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 8], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3], [0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 8], [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5, 6, 7], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 8, 7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10], [0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4], [0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8], [0, 1, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6], [0, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 10], [0, 0, 1, 0, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6], [0, 4, 8, 10, 12, 11, 12, 14, 13, 19, 20], [0, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7], [0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 7, 12, 11, 10, 14, 15], [0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 8], [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 6]]

**all_walks** is a list of lists: every sub-list represents a single random walk. If you convert this list of lists to a NumPy array, you can make interesting plots.
```
np_aw = np.array(all_walks)
plt.plot(all_walks)
plt.show()
```
![](img/graph_2.PNG)
```
# by calling np.transpose() every row represents the position after 1 throw for the 10 random walks
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np_aw)
plt.plot(np_aw_t)
plt.ylabel("all_walks")
plt.show()
```

### Implement clumsiness

To implement the clumsy condition we need to call for another random number generation. Basically, you can generate a random float between 0 and 1. If this value is less than or equal to 0.001, you should reset step to 0.
```
all_walks = []
for i in range(20) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(10) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

        # Implement clumsiness
        if np.random.rand() <= 0.001 :
            step = 0

        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)

# Create and plot np_aw_t
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np.array(all_walks))
plt.plot(np_aw_t)
plt.show()
```

### Plot the distribution

To finally solve the question _What are the odds that you'll reach 60 steps high on the Empire State Building?_
 Basically, we want to know about the end points of all the random walks you've simulated. These end points have a certain distribution that you can visualize with a histogram.

```
# Simulate random walk 500 times
all_walks = []
for i in range(500) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        if np.random.rand() <= 0.001 :
            step = 0
        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)

# Create and plot np_aw_t
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np.array(all_walks))

# Select last row from np_aw_t: ends
ends = np.array(np_aw_t[-1, :])

# Plot histogram of ends, display plot
plt.hist(ends, color='tomato')
plt.show()
```

### Calculate the odds

The histogram was created from NumPy array that contains 500 integers.
Each integer represents the end point of a random walk. To calculate the chance 
that this end point is greater than or equal to 60, we can count the number of integers 
in ends that are greater than or equal to 60 and divide that number by 500, the total 
number of simulations. What's the estimated chance that you'll reach at least 60 steps 
high if you play this Empire State Building game?

```
np.mean(ends >= 60) * 100
```

#### The answer is : 78.9%
